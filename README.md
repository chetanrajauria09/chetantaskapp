## ðŸ§  Architecture

- `MVVM` architecture with loose coupling between View and ViewModel
- Repository pattern for abstracting data layer
- Uses `async/await` for networking (no third-party dependencies)
- Fully programmatic UI using `UIKit` (no Storyboards)

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Used XCTest for unit testing
- Covered edge cases like:
  - Zero quantity
  - Negative P&L
  - No holdings
- Mock repository for isolated testing
- Code coverage: **92%+**

## ðŸ“² Requirements

- Xcode 16.4
- Swift 6.2
- iOS 15+
